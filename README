It's very simple batch sfv-file checker

It goes down the tree of ROOT, finds *.sfv and check them with "cksfv" (another python tool from repo).
If file goes through check with no errors - whole folder moved to AIM location.

Useful to run from cron, if you have download client with dc++, torrent, ftp or whatever.
